But should you want to jump in and  make a comment, please use the chat function or, you know, use the reaction function and then we'll get to hear you. I feel like I'm being so formal, but actually we kind of all know each other already and we can be like less formal today. It's great to see all of you. I think it's about two weeks since Bali, two very busy, hectic, hot weeks.  Linh Ly, I think we now have about, I don't know, we have 24 participants. Would you like to start us off, seeing that we have a very limited time, yeah?",Learner_10,0.0,53.835

62.613,120.47,"Thank you, Rejani. Hi, hi, hi, everyone. I hope you are all still excited to learn, to continue our journey.  Now we are entering unit seven, which is I already gave the material to you while we were in Bali, but I hope it will not discourage you to hear again, to listen again to what I will say to you. And I do hope that you have time to finish or at least to start the unit seven, quite long enough. But yeah, that's interesting.  So today we will talk about the climate risk, investing climate risk again. So we will run through within the time. So I will give you some also exercise. I hope you will enjoy it. And I will share the screen now to start with the session, yeah?",Trainer,0.01999999999999602,57.857
127.152,130.08,All right.  Here we go.,Learner_12,6.682000000000002,2.9280000000000115
130.1,340.142,"So unit seven, as you understand that we learn about the investing in climate and this alliance in natural resources. And in this unit, the key learning outcomes is understanding climate phase and the assessment. Then we will have a session to exercise about how to assess on a quantitatively.  And also we will share about the natural asset and ecosystem services based on her experience. And the third one is about the reporting.  So I will start and please if I will also ask you, please write it down the experience that you have facing all the three types of climate this you can you can write it down in the chat group. So if you have a.  evidence or you have experience about how to dealing with the climate risk, that will be very good if you can share with us and write it down in the chat room. So I will start first, the three types of climate risk, as I already explained in Bali, that there will be a physical risk,  that the risk linked to physical changes. So we can see visioning the changes. For example, for the acute extreme weather event in Asia.  it will create or it will make the impact on the agriculture, of course, because of the drought. And this can suddenly happen. For example, if we just sit now with the hot weather and then suddenly we have rain, for example, and we feel so hot while we were in Bali, but actually this is not the month of having a very hot season.  And then the other one is the chronic, gradual, but increasing. So this is also happening in many places. You can experience this as well.  So if you think that you also have a bad seeing or experiencing, just like our colleagues from India said, this is too hot here in India or in the Philippines or somewhere. So please, can you write it down in the chat room and then maybe you can share a little bit about what happened or what you experienced, all the thing or the physical risk.  linked to the physical changes in your area. So we need a better adaptation to change what we can do because we cannot just sit and then just do nothing because the impact is really great. In order to keep the resilience, especially to the livelihood and also to our activities, of course,  to the ability to withstand and recover from the shock. So if you have any experience, please kindly share in the chat room that, for example, Philippine, yeah, this happened because something. In India, yes, this happened because of something. So please kindly share as well.",Trainer,0.01999999999998181,210.042

344.73,347.451," All right, so anyone want to share about this?",Learner_8,3.1070000000000277,2.7210000000000036
347.891,410.518,"You can write it in the chat box, yeah? I believe that you also shared that, for example, for the business practices, the disalliance practices, because of the hazard exposure must be addressed.  And also the government were to focus the strategy and for the community services is good to have this evidence. So the civil society will have ability to lobby with the government or to the business sectors to slow down the risk. Yeah. Thank you.  Yeah, Chris shared that in the Philippines, unequal distribution in water in the country is still a major concern, water shortage, and maybe other can share about the experience.",Trainer,0.4399999999999977,62.62699999999995
411.879,412.059,Yeah.,Learner_13,1.3610000000000468,0.18000000000000682
414.033,755.327," All right, so again, the physical risk is the risk that you can see, or this is the evidence that will have a problem or have changes in your productivity or your daily activities.  Then the second types is the transitional risk, which is the risk that link to the net zero actually, how we can do the thing or the ability to adjust to a low carbon economy or development. So the transitional risk is very important. So we can anticipate what will happen in the next maybe a month, a year,  five years ahead. Because if we did not anticipate it, this will also impact our business, our production, and also the livelihood as well. The transition risks also reflect on the quality of life.  So this will be very effective if we acknowledge or understand and anticipate it in the very early or in the beginning of the period of your working plan, for example.  So it will reflect on the quality that you might raise. And this also can be seen on the policy, technology, and also market risk and reputation risk if you do the anticipation and also reflect on the quality of that you can achieve. So just recently, there is also a meeting on how  the climate risk will impact on the reputation as well. So now the multinationals is really, really okay, acknowledge this, and they also have enough budget because of doing the climate risk mitigation and do the transitional risk, they will get the positive reputation.  Yeah, so from the chat room also that we can see some of you already share me and also Jonathan that Cambodia also experienced stronger winds and in the Philippines experiencing the high temperature and also in Myanmar, underground water are not more accessible. So changing pattern in seasonal rains also effective  the farming. Yeah. So thank you for sharing this. A lot of you share already about the second types of transitional risk. Then the third risk, wait a bit slowly.  Then we will understand about the litigation risk, the risk linked to the legal liability and lawsuit failing to manage foreseeable risk. This means that if you did not anticipate the risk of the climate risk, then you might be facing problems, for example, due to the fire, due to the drought,  and also flood, because now people understand that the cost of climate change might happen to their livelihood. So the people will be easily sent about failing the lawsuit for the legal liability.  So if you are not ready, then this will cause a problem within the company, the business, and with the community especially. But in the case of Indonesia, the Minister of Environmental and Forestry already  to some of the company because of the fire, the haze. And this is really happening. So between the company and the government have a problem. And that's why we must anticipate the action and the impact, both direct and indirect. And this can be driven by anyone, not only by the business side, but also the government itself, because of the failure of managing the regulation.  and also by the society or the community as well. So this is very important for strategic litigation and to avoid the greenwashing, of course, and climate related to loss. So we have many chat in here. I think if Richani or Linli, can you point someone to share in this session?  Maybe from the participant, can you point one? Yeah. How about Chris? All right. Thank you. Chris, can you share your experience, what's happening in the Philippines, maybe two minutes?",Trainer,1.9739999999999895,341.294
757.008,831.656,"Oh, sure. Should I focus on the litigation risks or not really? Whatever.  Okay, so just now I was watching the news before our class. So as I mentioned in the chat box, the Senate people are actually discussing about adjusting the upcoming school year of the students due to very high temperature here now in the Philippines.  they are foreseeing that by August as well, there would be a lot of heavy rains and typhoons. So they want to adjust the school period for these kids in consideration of the safety of these students. So we are now really feeling the effects of the climate change. I believe now there is an existing talks, ASEAN talks now in  Bangkok, about this climate resiliency talks about that. So yes, this is really happening now and cannot be neglected. So I think this is really an urgent matter that should be considered by all sector. Okay.",Learner_11,1.68100000000004,74.64799999999991
832.956,837.278,All right. Thank you. Yeah. So the government put the tension on there. Yeah.,Learner_8,1.3000000000000682,4.322000000000003
839.192,868.623," Yes, they are taking it very seriously now. The parents interviewed in the news are strongly supporting this, especially considering the safety of their children. So it's quite dangerous now. And even the traffic enforcers are reported to have heat stroke, so they have to protect these people working at the streets. So it's very risky.",Learner_11,1.9139999999999873,29.43100000000004
870.783,1266.699," Yeah, yeah, thank you. All right, thank you so much for the share. So, yeah, thank you. So I believe that all of you understand about the three risks, yeah, from the physical, transitional and also litigation. And now the question is how we can use all the three types of climate risk in our doing our business, both from the government and also  the business and the community as well. So I will stop from here. Then we go to the next topic. Thank you, everyone, for sharing your experience. A bit slow to move. OK. So the mixed approach across risks means that we can see that the three risks, the three types of risks  need different quantitative and qualitative approaches. For example, how to litigate the heat wave because maybe you can count how many people sick and how much to charge the government or maybe to get the free medication because due to the heat. And maybe you need to talk to the farmers how much the impact of one accident due to the climate risk.  And you need to do it both quantitative and qualitatively. So this shows you how we can assess all the three risks. One is the physical risk is easily  measured or assessed by the quantitative one, but the transition risk more on qualitative. So you talk to the people and you see and ask their evidence, what about 10 years ago and now and what do you think for the next 10 years and how to make sure we will reach the net zero for the climate risk, for example, like that.  So then on the litigation risk, we do the combination because when you have to prove something, you need the data or maybe something evidence.  maybe by picture or maybe by recording something. But exactly, you need to have quantitative data as well. So based on this approach, now we understand that the value of assessment to avoid and mitigate impacts. You can see from this screen that by physical, it means the quantitative.  that for the business one, Climate Risk Alliance practices need to be measured. And government can focus on what regulation that they have to do and based on the data as well. So the quantitative approach. And the civil society will use the information to slow, to ask both the government and also the business to slow the climate risk. So it needs a quantitative approach.  And for the transition, you can measure or assess using the qualitative. So the business sector will see how to change the operation to get better or to adapt or to mitigate the climate risk.  And the government also can use the information to support the plan we'll be doing by the business and the civil society as well. And the civil society will use the information as evidence base to talk to the government and also to the business.  While in the litigation, you can use the mixed approach. So for the business sectors, exposure to opportunity and supply chains, you need both. Maybe you can also do using the quantitative and qualitative. And for the government, this mixed approach can understand the business and civil society better.  And for the civil society, when they want to do the class action to drive a positive action, then they must have to have the two things. That's the physical, the transition, the quantitative, and the qualitative. So this is all about the three ways that we learn from the e-learning material that we need to understand.  Now, what I want you to do is to exercise. I hope, I don't know how many of you already tried the exercise on the e-learning about how to measure or how to assess the climate risk assessment on the climate analytic, using Climate Impact Explorer. So now I ask David to help me to break out group. Actually, I design.  Yeah, I designed like this, so the participant from Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, become one group, and Thailand and India, Singapore and Malaysia. So please, can you join the breakout room? And we have 15 minutes. What I want you to do is, for example, for the Indonesia participants, then group one,  try to click the climate impact explorer and then go to see how the land fraction due to the heat wave and impact on the crop failure and also impact into the labor productivity and so on and so forth. In the Philippines, I tried to choose the typhoon and crop failure in Laos and Cambodia and the other.  Vietnam, but the annual crop and crop failure. Thailand and India may be on the annual flood, and Vietnam and Singapore and others, annual flood and crop failure as well. Why I did not ask you to select the region, because I don't know the region as well, but when I tried to use the Explorer, some did not have data.  Yeah, so I hope it's clear, then we can break out now.",Trainer,2.159999999999968,395.91600000000005

1334.83,1435.41,"Oh, yeah. You need to change. Yeah. So while waiting for David, then I can give an example of the quantitative  meaning that, for example, you run your business, usually you can produce 100 tons per year, but due to the climate risk, maybe due to the flooding or extreme weather, and you experience the haze,  heatwave and so on and so forth, then you understand that the production is not, cannot reach the highest one, but reducing and the input or the input, you need more input in producing the same amount. Yeah. So you calculate all that things become your quantitative data, right?  But the qualitative approach meaning that you need to talk to the people or the outgrower or your supplier or the supply chain on your supply chains that what sort of a different thing before we are facing the climate change and now. Yeah, maybe they will say  Now I need more petrol because of the bit of the water become less and I cannot move the ship from one point to another point within five hours.

So for example, the year 2020, there is 1.1 decrease in the labor productivity due to the increase of the temperature.  So even though Maria told us that even though the confidence level of this data is not that very good, but at least we have some things to be used as a baseline whenever we want to create or we want to develop a program that based on this kind of situations or this kind of assumptions.

For example, the Vietnam, we can select the province as you can see on the e-learning. So the indicator, you can also select which indicator that you want to see. For example, land fraction annually exposed to river flood, and so on and so forth. And yeah, by using that, then you can see the data here, the changes. This is baseline referred to 20 years period.  meaning that this baseline data and the increase 1.5 degrees, we can see that it impacts on the labor productivity due to the heat stress increasing from 3.1 to 4. Then you can see also on the map that the changes in labor productivity due to stress, it happening in most of the India region.  So you can see the color, means that the above minus 5 is happening in most in the region, but in the above area, maybe less because there's the mountainous. And they're still OK.

2822.143,2978.738,"Without pinpointing anyone. Thank you, Rejani. Right. So from our team, it was using the tool was the conclusion was we need to understand better the  the metrics that are listed in the tool. But how far we got was to look at these indicators from the first row, so we were able to do select countries, province, and then the scenarios at the last column there, we need to understand that better. But as I was playing around with the tool,  because we were on rice in my field. For the indicator, I looked at the annual mean rice yield. And then for the scenario, I'm just guessing whatever these scenarios mean, but I looked at RCP 8.5. And then what I found useful for the tool, at least for this scenario,  there's a projection by year about the global mean temperature and how that will affect the rice production in areas of the Philippines. So I chose this one province there in the Philippines, the province of Isabela. Sorry, I can't show my screen because I don't have  share screen options. And we found it helpful, at least to visualize what the potential impacts could be in terms in this case, in terms of rice production, and the changes in a span of that 20 year period, that's from 2030 to 2050, using the model.  at least what the model or what the scenario show is that there will be significant changes as the mean temperature globally rises from 1.5 to, I think in the model, it's around three degrees by 2060 centigrade. So that's really a significant level of change. And in terms of the map at the bottom of the screen, when we scroll down,  the changes in the color because I don't have the technical expertise to interpret the what the percentage change means but it does show like significant changes in terms of the intensity of the colors being used in that area in the province of Isabel.",Learner_6,1.4400000000000546,156.5949999999998

2997.83,3125.383,"So when we, when I tried to play around with the,  with the tool and at least what the team concluded is that we need to better understand what these scenarios are and what they represent. So we got as far as learning that if we hover around the themes like here, we get to read about the definitions of each. We get to choose the indicators and my favorite as always, mean rise yield.  Here are the changes and projections on the temperature based on the scenario RCP 8.5. I think that's greenhouse gas concentrations and its relation to global mean temperature over the course of several years here. So this is like 60, 40 years, four decades of projections worth in the model and how that compares with or how that affects  the annual mean rice yield in terms of percentage. I think what these intensifying colors indicate is just really indicating the change. I'm not sure if it's indicating positive or negative change in the sense that increases in yield or decreases in yield is what it's saying. But there is  The province of Isabela is somewhere here where I'm hovering my mouse. And that's one of the main producers of rice in the Philippines. So at least from this projection, the intensifying colors, I would assume indicate that the significant increase in terms of global mean temperatures will somehow ripple to a change in terms of the productivity  in that area. So that's as far as we could go. But admittedly, we need to study the indicators better and what they mean and what these percentages here mean. Maybe at our personal time.

So the color will become darker. Yeah, meaning that it will impact more in this region.  in the certain period. So you move from here to here.

But this is interesting to understand, to learn, and also to study what's the scenario and the reason and all the reference they have. So you can continue to read these tools in the e-learning. They have the reference.  And again, please understand that these tools cannot tell anything, cannot solve everything. But at least you can figure out what's going on. If you want to go further, then there is another tools that you can learn, but some have to pay. So I hope.  I hope you can enjoy after this. So you can just try and learn what you think that you can learn better after this. All right. Thank you, everyone. So I will move fast because we run off our time. We only have 20 minutes left. I'm sorry. So we now move to the natural mitigating and managing climate risk and natural resource risk.  I think I already explained this as well in Bali, that this is unavoidable, so managing the exposure and adapting the impact is a must.  and how we can support the farmers' resilience in the capacity, collaboration, and also infrastructure, especially how to reduce the greenhouse gas emission. And some of our colleagues already mentioned about water, water scarcity, water impact, and so on and so forth. So water management and efficiency is really needed in the micro level for the potential two minutes, and also ecosystem services, it was a direct and indirect impact on the ecological function.  Yeah, I will invite Linley to share a bit about your experience, how we can do to manage the climate and natural resources. Please, Linley.",Trainer,1.030999999999949,128.0279999999998
3323.722,3511.773,"Thanks, Maria. I'll be quick because I know we want to get to our next activity. But at the beginning, I know we started by sharing sort of risks from our own countries and areas. And one thing that we're  facing a lot in Australia is drought, which is a huge issue for us and something that here, I think we've come to terms to the droughts coming and it's this sort of, like you said, some of these are unavoidable at this point. And that there's now, you know, looking at how we can actually just help farmers get ready for this. And one of the things that we're seeing here is the sort of drought hubs, which are built in different locations.  their whole role is around translating science to actual action and technology and sort of creating that gap, filling that gap really of helping actual adoption on farm and helping farmers to actually get ready for drought and trial new technologies. But that's just something that I'm seeing here, but more across the region where  doing a lot of research at the moment, actually looking at the role of digital tools in helping people in mitigating and preparing for climate change. And I think there's a big role for technology in helping in this area. And one thing that we're hearing a lot of talk about is early warning systems and agro-meteorological services. So helping everyone in areas to be aware of  of what's coming and knowing, getting warnings of big sort of physical risks that are coming in time and making sure a part that really needs to be built is foundational layer of infrastructure.  and making sure that if there is these early warning systems that we're able to get that information back out to farmers and out to regions and really working on projects that help build that maturity and readiness and foundational layer for then these digital tools or other areas to come on top. And obviously one area that we work a lot in is in technology and we're seeing  lots of really amazing technology come out that is going to help in this area. There's variable rate irrigation, which is really going to help in terms of water management and making sure that we're using all of the resources that we have in the most efficient way.  There's also now seaweed that's being produced, which when cows eat it, they reduce their methane outputs by up to 90%. So huge impacts on greenhouse gas emissions, obviously, but then also on productivity. So I think there's a lot of positive things coming out. And I think there's a lot of role for new technology in that space, but also these, like I sort of said, these other  facilities like the drought hubs that are happening in Australia that bring this together and actually help that translation from science and new technology to actual applications and sort of making sure that everyone's being brought on that journey.",Learner_2,1.080000000000382,188.05099999999993

4120.944,4408.048,"Welcome back again. So we have a very short time left. Thank you for participating. And I see a little slow moving in.  one group and fast moving in another group. So this is interesting. So David asked me that someone asked me, especially group one, asked about what's the difference about the natural asset and ecosystem services. So basically, the ecosystem services is the service that you might lose to do the thing that you do. For example, if you cut the trees in the forest,  Yeah, so you will create erosion, sedimentation and flooding because the function of the ecosystem destroyed by cutting the trees. So we'll lose the non-timber forest product as well because you don't have any bees, any rattan anymore. So the function of the forest is there. So that's the ecosystem services, especially the ecosystem services related to agriculture  is how to manage the water resources. So once you destroy the water catchment area, meaning that you will have problem with the water system, so hydrological aspects. That's the function of ecosystem services. If you lose the trees, you cut the trees, then you will get more heat or maybe fire burning, for example.  But the natural assets mean that you lose the assets on your system. So the thing that you have is, for example, the natural assets mean that you cannot create by yourself. For example, the, how to say, on the agriculture. So the thing that you, forest,  have a double function, one as a natural asset and the ecosystem services as well. The asset is the standing stock of the tree. That's the natural asset. But the ecosystem services is the services, the function of the tree, for example, like that.  I hope it can explain to you the difference between natural assets and also the ecosystem services. So the ecosystem services is the function. You lose the function. But the natural asset is the asset itself. The standing trees, the crop, the mangrove, the coral reefs, the fish, something like that. Yeah. All right. So thanks for participating the second exercise. Now I will share  Again, the unit. We move to the final one is the reporting. Climate reporting is very important as a part of the business and the government disclosure as well.  such as climate specific reporting standard and also reporting standards specifically related to emission. So there are a lot of reports that you can also see, maybe the World Bank, the UNEP, the IPCC, they have their own standard in reporting about the climate and specific reporting standard and also relate to the emission, sorry.  And for the business, the report on climate risk efficiently and accurately is very needed. Because this is related to your plan on the company's climate action plan for risk assessment and database for the litigation risk. So this is for the business is very important because that means that you have the data, you have the plan for yourself internally.  for the next production process or the long-term plan, something. And on the other side, if you have the database, then if there's something happen, maybe someone put the lawsuit on your business, then you can use it to fight the risk for the litigation. And also the government have the national standard on providing the...  providing a basic set of requirements for the severity and the risk of climate change and as a resource for agriculture and food businesses. So now my question before we end up.",Trainer,0.06000000000040018,287.10399999999936
