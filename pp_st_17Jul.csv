0,learners_most_time,4.722222222222222,"Hi Can I clarify what’s the difference between SkillsFuture and Skills Framework? There, it’s here. I’ll touch on the MySkillsFuture website later. Let’s click into TAE SFW (https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/skills-framework/tae#). John, any questions? Okay? Yup. Okay.  This website is not the most well-organised. Some links quite obscure. So that’s why we need a course for this. Miranda, can you see it? ",Trainer,"based on the provided text, it appears that the instructor or facilitator is speaking most of the time. the text includes explanations, instructions, and questions directed at the learners, but there are only brief responses from the learners, such as ""okay?"" and ""yup."" therefore, it seems that the learners do not speak most of the time in this segment of the discussion."
1,learners_spontaneous,4.0740740740740735,"Yup, can see. Can someone answer me [this]? Why is there a Word and a PDF version?’ One is editable. One is not. As I mentioned, this SFW is available to everyone. So a HR might not need all the info, so the HR can edit on the Word doc. Okay? Understand? Yessss. ",Shirley,"based on the text provided, it appears that learners speak spontaneously. the initial question ""can someone answer me [this]?"" suggests that the learner is actively seeking information without being directly prompted. additionally, the responses ""one is editable. one is not."" and ""as i mentioned, this sfw is available to everyone..."" indicate that participants are contributing to the discussion freely and providing explanations without needing an invitation to do so. the final affirmation ""yessss."" further suggests that the learners are engaged and responsive in the conversation."
2,learners_take_turns,2.685185185185185,"Question. There are so many roles, right? Are these all for the same sector?  You tell me. Later you read and you tell me. What kind of info should you be looking at when looking at sector information?  The first 10 pages should give you info on that. Just first 10 pages. Don’t go beyond that. Just look at the info. What info seems most interesting to you? Let’s start with Shirley. Shirley? Huh?  What info here is interesting to you? [reads from the website] Who is it for? ",Trainer,"no, the learners do not take turns speaking without being requested by the trainer. the trainer appears to be guiding the conversation, asking specific questions, and directing the learners to respond. for example, the trainer asks shirley directly for her input: ""let’s start with shirley. shirley? huh? what info here is interesting to you?"" this indicates that the trainer is controlling the flow of the discussion and prompting individual learners to participate."
3,trainer_reflective_questioning,8.518518518518517,"This is question 3 in your challenge, ar, by the way. Who is it for? So who is it for?  [reads from the website] Individuals, employers and training providers Thank you. Okay, George. How does this apply to you? I want to take this course because I want to be an adult educator and I can see the skills I need.  Yes, so from here you can see what skills you already have and what skills you need. Very good. Thank you. Next, Samy. Which term resonates with you the most?",John,"yes, the trainer uses reflective questioning in the text. reflective questioning involves asking questions that encourage individuals to think deeply about their experiences, motivations, and understanding. in the provided text, the trainer asks george, ""how does this apply to you?"" this question prompts george to reflect on his personal reasons for wanting to take the course and how it aligns with his goals of becoming an adult educator. this type of questioning helps individuals connect the course content to their personal and professional development."
4,trainer_encourage_expansion,4.351851851851851,"Customer Orientation, because I work in the frontline, so always face customers.  Yes, but respond in the context of a TAE, not in your current role. So, in the TAE, our learners are like our customers. Like that correct? Yes. Okay. Now class, you must interpret the term and use examples, so that’s how you should answer Question 3. Okay, who else? Page 3. I think the diagram on page 3 is very good. Show everything. ",Trainer,"yes, the trainer encourages learners to expand on what they said. the trainer prompts the learner to think about the term ""customer orientation"" in the context of a tae (training and assessment environment) and to use examples to interpret the term. this is evident when the trainer says, ""yes, but respond in the context of a tae, not in your current role. so, in the tae, our learners are like our customers. like that correct?"" and ""now class, you must interpret the term and use examples, so that’s how you should answer question 3."" these prompts guide the learners to deepen their understanding and provide more detailed responses."
5,trainer_justify_statements,6.018518518518518,"Ya. So you can see…this is not a sunsetting industry. If this is a sunsetting industry, there won’t be a SFW for it. There are 20 thousand adult educators ar. Okay. Look at Future Development. What are some trends that caught your eye? The Future Development. This is what is behind the ACLP and the DDDLP, the revamp of the ACTA and DACE because these ACTA, DACE were lacking technology. Choon Sim, which one appeals to you?’  Learning technology. Yes, we’re doing that next week. Okay, these trends then give rise to a set of skills. Are these skills you already have? Need to have? Want to have? Are these the skills I need now? These are what the industry needs. Depends on which role you play. So you’re an AE, would you need Customer Orientation? Who’s your customer? Your training provider or your learner?",John,"yes, the trainer appears to require learners to justify what they said. this is evident from the way the trainer asks probing questions to encourage deeper thinking and reflection. for example, the trainer asks, ""are these skills you already have? need to have? want to have? are these the skills i need now?"" and ""depends on which role you play. so you’re an ae, would you need customer orientation? who’s your customer? your training provider or your learner?"" these questions prompt the learners to consider their own skills and roles critically and justify their thoughts and decisions."
