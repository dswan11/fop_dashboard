11,22,Can I clarify what’s the difference between SkillsFuture and Skills Framework?,Shirley,10.0,11
24,45,"There, it’s here. I’ll touch on the MySkillsFuture website later. Let’s click into TAE SFW (https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/skills-framework/tae#). John, any questions? Okay?",Trainer,2.0,21
46,48,Yup. Okay. ,John,1.0,2
49,75,"This website is not the most well-organised. Some links quite obscure. So that’s why we need a course for this. Miranda, can you see it? ",Trainer,1.0,26
80,83,"Yup, can see.",John,5.0,3
84,98,Can someone answer me [this]? Why is there a Word and a PDF version?’,Trainer,1.0,14
106,112,One is editable. One is not.,Tammy,8.0,6
113,142,"As I mentioned, this SFW is available to everyone. So a HR might not need all the info, so the HR can edit on the Word doc. Okay? Understand?",Trainer,1.0,29
143,144,Yessss. ,Students,1.0,1
145,159,"Question. There are so many roles, right? Are these all for the same sector? ",Bee Choo,1.0,14
160,250,You tell me. Later you read and you tell me. What kind of info should you be looking at when looking at sector information?  The first 10 pages should give you info on that. Just first 10 pages. Don’t go beyond that. Just look at the info. What info seems most interesting to you? Let’s start with Shirley. Shirley?,Trainer,1.0,90
252,253,Huh? ,Shirley,2.0,1

345,375,"Yes, so from here you can see what skills you already have and what skills you need. Very good. Thank you. Next, Samy. Which term resonates with you the most?",Trainer,2.0,30
378,390,"Customer Orientation, because I work in the frontline, so always face customers. ",Samy,3.0,12
391,405,"Yes, but respond in the context of a TAE, not in your current role.",Trainer,1.0,14
407,420,"So, in the TAE, our learners are like our customers. Like that correct?",Samy,2.0,13
422,446,"Yes. Okay. Now class, you must interpret the term and use examples, so that’s how you should answer Question 3. Okay, who else?",Trainer,2.0,24
449,463,Page 3. I think the diagram on page 3 is very good. Show everything. ,Meng,3.0,14
464,551,"Ya. So you can see…this is not a sunsetting industry. If this is a sunsetting industry, there won’t be a SFW for it. There are 20 thousand adult educators ar. Okay. Look at Future Development. What are some trends that caught your eye? The Future Development. This is what is behind the ACLP and the DDDLP, the revamp of the ACTA and DACE because these ACTA, DACE were lacking technology. Choon Sim, which one appeals to you?’ ",Trainer,1.0,87

598,605,Are these the skills I need now?,Siew Lee,9.0,7
607,637,"These are what the industry needs. Depends on which role you play. So you’re an AE, would you need Customer Orientation? Who’s your customer? Your training provider or your learner?",Trainer,2.0,30
647,654,"Wah, need to do so many things?",Siew Lee,10.0,7
659,678,Do you need to do everything here? ‘Managing vendor’? Do I need to do it? I’m a vendor myself.,Trainer,5.0,19
681,683,No need.,Siew Lee,3.0,2
685,713,"Yes, correct. Not all the job functions are relevant, depends on your role, your company. Class, let’s say you’re a learning facilitator. What skills you need to have? ",Trainer,2.0,28

750,832,"Yes, very good. What is knowledge? What is ability? Can someone read out the ‘ability’?  Okay, good. Now coaching and mentoring. Look through the ‘knowledge’ and ‘ability’. Do you have what it takes? Having said that, not every company needs you to have all the skills ah? This is not cast in stone. SFW is just a framework. Okay, let’s move on. Okay, what’s the last component? We’ve covered three components. What’s the last one? We did sector info, career pathways, CCS.",Trainer,1.0,82
