0,learners_most_time,3.392857142857143," Right, thank you. And when Maria and Lily are running the session, if you can keep your microphones on mute, that'll be great. But should you want to jump in and  make a comment, please use the chat function or, you know, use the reaction function and then we'll get to hear you. I feel like I'm being so formal, but actually we kind of all know each other already and we can be like less formal today. It's great to see all of you. I think it's about two weeks since Bali, two very busy, hectic, hot weeks.  Linh Ly, I think we now have about, I don't know, we have 24 participants. Would you like to start us off, seeing that we have a very limited time, yeah? Yeah. Great. Over to you, Maria and Linh Ly. Okay. Thank you, Rejani. Hi, hi, hi, everyone. I hope you are all still excited to learn, to continue our journey.  Now we are entering unit seven, which is I already gave the material to you while we were in Bali, but I hope it will not discourage you to hear again, to listen again to what I will say to you. And I do hope that you have time to finish or at least to start the unit seven, quite long enough. But yeah, that's interesting.  So today we will talk about the climate risk, investing climate risk again. So we will run through within the time. So I will give you some also exercise. I hope you will enjoy it. And I will share the screen now to start with the session, yeah? All right.  Here we go.",Learner_10,"in the provided text, the learners do not speak most of the time. the facilitator, rejani, is the one who speaks the most, giving instructions and setting the tone for the session. the learners are mostly passive recipients of information and instructions, with occasional opportunities to interact through the chat function or reactions. the facilitator, maria, also speaks to introduce the topic and provide some guidance on the session's content. overall, the facilitators seem to have more speaking time compared to the"
1,learners_spontaneous,3.1547619047619047,"So unit seven, as you understand that we learn about the investing in climate and this alliance in natural resources. And in this unit, the key learning outcomes is understanding climate phase and the assessment. Then we will have a session to exercise about how to assess on a quantitatively.  And also we will share about the natural asset and ecosystem services based on her experience. And the third one is about the reporting.  So I will start and please if I will also ask you, please write it down the experience that you have facing all the three types of climate this you can you can write it down in the chat group. So if you have a.  evidence or you have experience about how to dealing with the climate risk, that will be very good if you can share with us and write it down in the chat room. So I will start first, the three types of climate risk, as I already explained in Bali, that there will be a physical risk,  that the risk linked to physical changes. So we can see visioning the changes. For example, for the acute extreme weather event in Asia.  it will create or it will make the impact on the agriculture, of course, because of the drought. And this can suddenly happen. For example, if we just sit now with the hot weather and then suddenly we have rain, for example, and we feel so hot while we were in Bali, but actually this is not the month of having a very hot season.  And then the other one is the chronic, gradual, but increasing. So this is also happening in many places. You can experience this as well.  So if you think that you also have a bad seeing or experiencing, just like our colleagues from India said, this is too hot here in India or in the Philippines or somewhere. So please, can you write it down in the chat room and then maybe you can share a little bit about what happened or what you experienced, all the thing or the physical risk.  linked to the physical changes in your area. So we need a better adaptation to change what we can do because we cannot just sit and then just do nothing because the impact is really great. In order to keep the resilience, especially to the livelihood and also to our activities, of course,  to the ability to withstand and recover from the shock. So if you have any experience, please kindly share in the chat room that, for example, Philippine, yeah, this happened because something. In India, yes, this happened because of something. So please kindly share as well. Yeah.  All right, so anyone want to share about this? You can write it in the chat box, yeah? I believe that you also shared that, for example, for the business practices, the disalliance practices, because of the hazard exposure must be addressed.  And also the government were to focus the strategy and for the community services is good to have this evidence. So the civil society will have ability to lobby with the government or to the business sectors to slow down the risk. Yeah. Thank you.  Yeah, Chris shared that in the Philippines, unequal distribution in water in the country is still a major concern, water shortage, and maybe other can share about the experience. Yeah.",Learner_3,"in this text, it appears that the learners need to be invited to speak and share their experiences. the speaker prompts the participants to write down their experiences in the chat room and specifically asks for examples related to climate risks and physical changes in their areas. the speaker encourages participation by mentioning specific examples from bali, india, and the philippines and emphasizes the importance of sharing to better understand and address climate risks. the learners may not speak spontaneously but require prompting and encouragement to actively engage in the discussion."
2,learners_take_turns,6.011904761904762," All right, so again, the physical risk is the risk that you can see, or this is the evidence that will have a problem or have changes in your productivity or your daily activities.  Then the second types is the transitional risk, which is the risk that link to the net zero actually, how we can do the thing or the ability to adjust to a low carbon economy or development. So the transitional risk is very important. So we can anticipate what will happen in the next maybe a month, a year,  five years ahead. Because if we did not anticipate it, this will also impact our business, our production, and also the livelihood as well. The transition risks also reflect on the quality of life.  So this will be very effective if we acknowledge or understand and anticipate it in the very early or in the beginning of the period of your working plan, for example.  So it will reflect on the quality that you might raise. And this also can be seen on the policy, technology, and also market risk and reputation risk if you do the anticipation and also reflect on the quality of that you can achieve. So just recently, there is also a meeting on how  the climate risk will impact on the reputation as well. So now the multinationals is really, really okay, acknowledge this, and they also have enough budget because of doing the climate risk mitigation and do the transitional risk, they will get the positive reputation.  Yeah, so from the chat room also that we can see some of you already share me and also Jonathan that Cambodia also experienced stronger winds and in the Philippines experiencing the high temperature and also in Myanmar, underground water are not more accessible. So changing pattern in seasonal rains also effective  the farming. Yeah. So thank you for sharing this. A lot of you share already about the second types of transitional risk. Then the third risk, wait a bit slowly.  Then we will understand about the litigation risk, the risk linked to the legal liability and lawsuit failing to manage foreseeable risk. This means that if you did not anticipate the risk of the climate risk, then you might be facing problems, for example, due to the fire, due to the drought,  and also flood, because now people understand that the cost of climate change might happen to their livelihood. So the people will be easily sent about failing the lawsuit for the legal liability.  So if you are not ready, then this will cause a problem within the company, the business, and with the community especially. But in the case of Indonesia, the Minister of Environmental and Forestry already  to some of the company because of the fire, the haze. And this is really happening. So between the company and the government have a problem. And that's why we must anticipate the action and the impact, both direct and indirect. And this can be driven by anyone, not only by the business side, but also the government itself, because of the failure of managing the regulation.  and also by the society or the community as well. So this is very important for strategic litigation and to avoid the greenwashing, of course, and climate related to loss. So we have many chat in here. I think if Richani or Linli, can you point someone to share in this session?  Maybe from the participant, can you point one? Yeah. How about Chris? All right. Thank you. Chris, can you share your experience, what's happening in the Philippines, maybe two minutes? Oh, sure. Should I focus on the litigation risks or not really? Whatever.  Okay, so just now I was watching the news before our class. So as I mentioned in the chat box, the Senate people are actually discussing about adjusting the upcoming school year of the students due to very high temperature here now in the Philippines.  they are foreseeing that by August as well, there would be a lot of heavy rains and typhoons. So they want to adjust the school period for these kids in consideration of the safety of these students. So we are now really feeling the effects of the climate change. I believe now there is an existing talks, ASEAN talks now in  Bangkok, about this climate resiliency talks about that. So yes, this is really happening now and cannot be neglected. So I think this is really an urgent matter that should be considered by all sector. Okay. All right. Thank you. Yeah. So the government put the tension on there. Yeah.  Yes, they are taking it very seriously now. The parents interviewed in the news are strongly supporting this, especially considering the safety of their children. So it's quite dangerous now. And even the traffic enforcers are reported to have heat stroke, so they have to protect these people working at the streets. So it's very risky.  Yeah, yeah, thank you. All right, thank you so much for the share. So, yeah, thank you. So I believe that all of you understand about the three risks, yeah, from the physical, transitional and also litigation. And now the question is how we can use all the three types of climate risk in our doing our business, both from the government and also  the business and the community as well. So I will stop from here. Then we go to the next topic. Thank you, everyone, for sharing your experience. A bit slow to move. OK. So the mixed approach across risks means that we can see that the three risks, the three types of risks  need different quantitative and qualitative approaches. For example, how to litigate the heat wave because maybe you can count how many people sick and how much to charge the government or maybe to get the free medication because due to the heat. And maybe you need to talk to the farmers how much the impact of one accident due to the climate risk.  And you need to do it both quantitative and qualitatively. So this shows you how we can assess all the three risks. One is the physical risk is easily  measured or assessed by the quantitative one, but the transition risk more on qualitative. So you talk to the people and you see and ask their evidence, what about 10 years ago and now and what do you think for the next 10 years and how to make sure we will reach the net zero for the climate risk, for example, like that.  So then on the litigation risk, we do the combination because when you have to prove something, you need the data or maybe something evidence.  maybe by picture or maybe by recording something. But exactly, you need to have quantitative data as well. So based on this approach, now we understand that the value of assessment to avoid and mitigate impacts. You can see from this screen that by physical, it means the quantitative.  that for the business one, Climate Risk Alliance practices need to be measured. And government can focus on what regulation that they have to do and based on the data as well. So the quantitative approach. And the civil society will use the information to slow, to ask both the government and also the business to slow the climate risk. So it needs a quantitative approach.  And for the transition, you can measure or assess using the qualitative. So the business sector will see how to change the operation to get better or to adapt or to mitigate the climate risk.  And the government also can use the information to support the plan we'll be doing by the business and the civil society as well. And the civil society will use the information as evidence base to talk to the government and also to the business.  While in the litigation, you can use the mixed approach. So for the business sectors, exposure to opportunity and supply chains, you need both. Maybe you can also do using the quantitative and qualitative. And for the government, this mixed approach can understand the business and civil society better.  And for the civil society, when they want to do the class action to drive a positive action, then they must have to have the two things. That's the physical, the transition, the quantitative, and the qualitative. So this is all about the three ways that we learn from the e-learning material that we need to understand.  Now, what I want you to do is to exercise. I hope, I don't know how many of you already tried the exercise on the e-learning about how to measure or how to assess the climate risk assessment on the climate analytic, using Climate Impact Explorer. So now I ask David to help me to break out group. Actually, I design.  Yeah, I designed like this, so the participant from Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, become one group, and Thailand and India, Singapore and Malaysia. So please, can you join the breakout room? And we have 15 minutes. What I want you to do is, for example, for the Indonesia participants, then group one,  try to click the climate impact explorer and then go to see how the land fraction due to the heat wave and impact on the crop failure and also impact into the labor productivity and so on and so forth. In the Philippines, I tried to choose the typhoon and crop failure in Laos and Cambodia and the other.  Vietnam, but the annual crop and crop failure. Thailand and India may be on the annual flood, and Vietnam and Singapore and others, annual flood and crop failure as well. Why I did not ask you to select the region, because I don't know the region as well, but when I tried to use the Explorer, some did not have data.  Yeah, so I hope it's clear, then we can break out now.",Learner_10,"yes, learners do take turns speaking without being requested by the trainer. in the transcript provided, we can see that chris voluntarily shares his experience and insights without being specifically asked by the trainer. this shows active participation and engagement from the learners in the discussion."
3,trainer_reflective_questioning,7.976190476190476,"We have until... Maria, we were anticipating more people in some groups. So I think we only have two people in Indonesia, two people in Thailand, India, and two people in Singapore, Malaysia. Let me show you the results. So I think we'll just do three breakout rooms instead of five.  Sure, sure, sure, no problem. So you can, yeah, Philippines alone, and Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia alone, and Thailand, India, Singapore, and Asia will be into one group. Yeah. Thank you. You also have a question by Neemol, asking for some examples of quantitative and qualitative approaches for accessing climate risks. Would you like to answer that later after the breakout?  I think I answer later, yeah?",Trainer,"yes, the trainer uses reflective questioning in this text. reflective questioning involves repeating or paraphrasing what was said by another person to confirm understanding or to encourage further discussion. in this case, the trainer repeats the information about the number of people in different groups and confirms the plan to have three breakout rooms instead of five. the trainer also reflects on the question asked by neemol about quantitative and qualitative approaches for accessing climate risks and suggests answering it later after the breakout. this shows that the trainer is"
4,trainer_encourage_expansion,5.833333333333333,"Yeah. Right. Thank you, Nemo. I back to you. Thank you. So can we do the exercise? Just a moment. Yeah. Oh, yeah. You need to change. Yeah. So while waiting for David, then I can give an example of the quantitative  meaning that, for example, you run your business, usually you can produce 100 tons per year, but due to the climate risk, maybe due to the flooding or extreme weather, and you experience the haze,  heatwave and so on and so forth, then you understand that the production is not, cannot reach the highest one, but reducing and the input or the input, you need more input in producing the same amount. Yeah. So you calculate all that things become your quantitative data, right?  But the qualitative approach meaning that you need to talk to the people or the outgrower or your supplier or the supply chain on your supply chains that what sort of a different thing before we are facing the climate change and now. Yeah, maybe they will say  Now I need more petrol because of the bit of the water become less and I cannot move the ship from one point to another point within five hours. But now you need, say, 10 hours. So you need more petrol and engine and so on.",Learner_12,"based on the text provided, it does not appear that the trainer is explicitly encouraging learners to expand on what they said. the trainer seems to be leading the discussion and providing examples and explanations without specifically prompting the learners to contribute further or elaborate on their own thoughts. the trainer is primarily focused on explaining the concepts of quantitative and qualitative approaches in the context of climate change impacts on business operations."
5,trainer_justify_statements,2.083333333333333,"Can I open the rooms, Maria? Sure. And then, OK, just a moment.  Oh, I sent the hosts in too. All right, that was a bad idea.  I can't hear you, Lindy. Oh, sorry. I think everyone's across in rooms. So pull them out or what? I don't know if they know how to get, yeah, if they know how to get out or not. I can see if they're talking. Rajani's talking at the moment.",Trainer,"based on the provided text, it does not appear that the trainer is requiring learners to justify what they said. the conversation seems to be more focused on practical tasks and communication within a group setting, rather than on justifying or explaining statements made by individuals."
