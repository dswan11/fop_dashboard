0,learners_most_time,2.642857142857143," Right, thank you. And when Maria and Lily are running the session, if you can keep your microphones on mute, that'll be great. But should you want to jump in and  make a comment, please use the chat function or, you know, use the reaction function and then we'll get to hear you. I feel like I'm being so formal, but actually we kind of all know each other already and we can be like less formal today. It's great to see all of you. I think it's about two weeks since Bali, two very busy, hectic, hot weeks.  Linh Ly, I think we now have about, I don't know, we have 24 participants. Would you like to start us off, seeing that we have a very limited time, yeah?",Learner_10,"based on the provided text, it appears that learner_10 is actively facilitating the discussion, giving instructions, and guiding the flow of the session. learner_10 speaks about managing microphone usage, using chat or reaction functions to participate, and makes informal remarks about having known each other already. they also prompt another individual, linh ly, to start since there is limited time.

however, this singular excerpt doesn't provide enough information about the overall participation dynamics during the entire session. from this snippet alone"
1,learners_spontaneous,2.988095238095238,Yeah. Great.,Learner_3,"based on the provided text, ""yeah. great."" spoken by learner_3, itâ€™s not possible to definitively determine whether learners speak spontaneously or need to be invited. this specific response could be spontaneous expression of agreement or approval, or it could be a reaction to something that was solicited by another participant in the conversation. to make a robust conclusion, more context and examples from the discussion would be necessary."
2,learners_take_turns,1.4880952380952381,"Over to you, Maria and Linh Ly. Okay.",Learner_10,"based on the text you provided, it appears that learner_10 is signaling that it is now maria and linh ly's turn to speak by saying, ""over to you, maria and linh ly."" this suggests that there might be some form of structure or established protocol where learners know when they are supposed to take turns or who is supposed to speak next, possibly without explicit direction from the trainer at that moment. therefore, it seems that learners could be taking turns speaking in an orderly manner"
3,trainer_reflective_questioning,2.3214285714285716,"Thank you, Rejani. Hi, hi, hi, everyone. I hope you are all still excited to learn, to continue our journey.  Now we are entering unit seven, which is I already gave the material to you while we were in Bali, but I hope it will not discourage you to hear again, to listen again to what I will say to you. And I do hope that you have time to finish or at least to start the unit seven, quite long enough. But yeah, that's interesting.  So today we will talk about the climate risk, investing climate risk again. So we will run through within the time. So I will give you some also exercise. I hope you will enjoy it. And I will share the screen now to start with the session, yeah?",Trainer,"no, the trainer does not use reflective questioning in this text. reflective questioning involves asking questions that encourage participants to think deeply about what they have learned or experienced. in this excerpt, the trainer mainly provides information and instructions rather than posing reflective or analytical questions to the audience. the text is focused on introducing the session, explaining the content, and outlining what will be covered, without engaging the participants in reflective thinking through questions."
4,trainer_encourage_expansion,2.5476190476190474,All right.  Here we go.,Learner_12,"the excerpt provided by learner_12 consists of brief, preparatory phrases: ""all right. here we go."" these statements indicate that learner_12 is likely about to begin an activity or discussion. 

without additional context or responses from the trainer, it's not possible to determine if the trainer encourages learners to expand on what they said based solely on this excerpt. the given text doesn't provide enough information to assess the trainer's approach to promoting elaboration from learners."
5,trainer_justify_statements,1.6666666666666667,"So unit seven, as you understand that we learn about the investing in climate and this alliance in natural resources. And in this unit, the key learning outcomes is understanding climate phase and the assessment. Then we will have a session to exercise about how to assess on a quantitatively.  And also we will share about the natural asset and ecosystem services based on her experience. And the third one is about the reporting.  So I will start and please if I will also ask you, please write it down the experience that you have facing all the three types of climate this you can you can write it down in the chat group. So if you have a.  evidence or you have experience about how to dealing with the climate risk, that will be very good if you can share with us and write it down in the chat room. So I will start first, the three types of climate risk, as I already explained in Bali, that there will be a physical risk,  that the risk linked to physical changes. So we can see visioning the changes. For example, for the acute extreme weather event in Asia.  it will create or it will make the impact on the agriculture, of course, because of the drought. And this can suddenly happen. For example, if we just sit now with the hot weather and then suddenly we have rain, for example, and we feel so hot while we were in Bali, but actually this is not the month of having a very hot season.  And then the other one is the chronic, gradual, but increasing. So this is also happening in many places. You can experience this as well.  So if you think that you also have a bad seeing or experiencing, just like our colleagues from India said, this is too hot here in India or in the Philippines or somewhere. So please, can you write it down in the chat room and then maybe you can share a little bit about what happened or what you experienced, all the thing or the physical risk.  linked to the physical changes in your area. So we need a better adaptation to change what we can do because we cannot just sit and then just do nothing because the impact is really great. In order to keep the resilience, especially to the livelihood and also to our activities, of course,  to the ability to withstand and recover from the shock. So if you have any experience, please kindly share in the chat room that, for example, Philippine, yeah, this happened because something. In India, yes, this happened because of something. So please kindly share as well.",Trainer,"yes, the trainer does implicitly require learners to justify what they have experienced regarding climate risk. the trainer asks participants to share their experiences and provide evidence or examples to support their assertions. here are the relevant parts of the text where this is evident:

1. **sharing experiences and evidence**:
   - ""so if you have a. evidence or you have experience about how to dealing with the climate risk, that will be very good if you can share with us and write it down in the chat room"
