0,learners_most_time,3.5595238095238093," Right, thank you. And when Maria and Lily are running the session, if you can keep your microphones on mute, that'll be great. But should you want to jump in and  make a comment, please use the chat function or, you know, use the reaction function and then we'll get to hear you. I feel like I'm being so formal, but actually we kind of all know each other already and we can be like less formal today. It's great to see all of you. I think it's about two weeks since Bali, two very busy, hectic, hot weeks.  Linh Ly, I think we now have about, I don't know, we have 24 participants. Would you like to start us off, seeing that we have a very limited time, yeah?",Learner_10,"based on the provided text, it appears that the learner learner_10 is speaking and taking an active role in the discussion. learner_10 is giving instructions and setting the tone for the session, suggesting that they have an influential presence in the conversation. learner_10 also acknowledges familiarity with the participants, which indicates a level of comfort and possibly frequent participation in discussions. overall, while it is not definitive that learners speak most of the time, learner_10's engagement and facilitation"
1,learners_spontaneous,4.380952380952381,Yeah. Great.,Learner_3,"learners can speak spontaneously or may need to be invited to join a discussion or share their thoughts. in this case, learner_3's response of ""yeah. great."" suggests a brief and somewhat neutral reaction. it is possible that learner_3 may have been prompted to respond, or they may have chosen to chime in with a brief comment without much elaboration. the context of the discussion and the dynamics within the group can influence whether learners speak spontaneously or require prompting to participate"
2,learners_take_turns,5.071428571428571,"Over to you, Maria and Linh Ly. Okay.",Learner_10,"yes, learners may take turns speaking without being specifically requested by the trainer, especially in a group discussion setting where participants are expected to engage in conversation and contribute their thoughts and ideas. learners can naturally transition between speakers or address specific individuals to continue the discussion. in the provided text, learner_10 appears to voluntarily hand over the speaking turn to maria and linh ly, indicating an organic flow of conversation within the group."
3,trainer_reflective_questioning,3.4047619047619047,"Thank you, Rejani. Hi, hi, hi, everyone. I hope you are all still excited to learn, to continue our journey.  Now we are entering unit seven, which is I already gave the material to you while we were in Bali, but I hope it will not discourage you to hear again, to listen again to what I will say to you. And I do hope that you have time to finish or at least to start the unit seven, quite long enough. But yeah, that's interesting.  So today we will talk about the climate risk, investing climate risk again. So we will run through within the time. So I will give you some also exercise. I hope you will enjoy it. And I will share the screen now to start with the session, yeah?",Trainer,"yes, the trainer uses reflective questioning in the text by asking if the participants are still excited to learn and continue their journey, despite having received the material previously. this shows the trainer's interest in the participants' engagement and willingness to revisit the content. the trainer also prompts the participants to reflect on their progress by mentioning the importance of finishing or starting the unit, indicating a level of reflection on their learning journey."
4,trainer_encourage_expansion,3.4047619047619047,All right.  Here we go.,Learner_12,"based on the text provided (""all right. here we go."") spoken by learner_12, it does not appear that the trainer is specifically encouraging learners to expand on what they said. the phrase ""all right. here we go."" seems more like a general indication that something is about to start or that a task is beginning, rather than prompting learners to elaborate on their previous statements."
5,trainer_justify_statements,1.630952380952381,"So unit seven, as you understand that we learn about the investing in climate and this alliance in natural resources. And in this unit, the key learning outcomes is understanding climate phase and the assessment. Then we will have a session to exercise about how to assess on a quantitatively.  And also we will share about the natural asset and ecosystem services based on her experience. And the third one is about the reporting.  So I will start and please if I will also ask you, please write it down the experience that you have facing all the three types of climate this you can you can write it down in the chat group. So if you have a.  evidence or you have experience about how to dealing with the climate risk, that will be very good if you can share with us and write it down in the chat room. So I will start first, the three types of climate risk, as I already explained in Bali, that there will be a physical risk,  that the risk linked to physical changes. So we can see visioning the changes. For example, for the acute extreme weather event in Asia.  it will create or it will make the impact on the agriculture, of course, because of the drought. And this can suddenly happen. For example, if we just sit now with the hot weather and then suddenly we have rain, for example, and we feel so hot while we were in Bali, but actually this is not the month of having a very hot season.  And then the other one is the chronic, gradual, but increasing. So this is also happening in many places. You can experience this as well.  So if you think that you also have a bad seeing or experiencing, just like our colleagues from India said, this is too hot here in India or in the Philippines or somewhere. So please, can you write it down in the chat room and then maybe you can share a little bit about what happened or what you experienced, all the thing or the physical risk.  linked to the physical changes in your area. So we need a better adaptation to change what we can do because we cannot just sit and then just do nothing because the impact is really great. In order to keep the resilience, especially to the livelihood and also to our activities, of course,  to the ability to withstand and recover from the shock. So if you have any experience, please kindly share in the chat room that, for example, Philippine, yeah, this happened because something. In India, yes, this happened because of something. So please kindly share as well.",Trainer,"yes, the trainer in this text encourages learners to share their experiences and evidence related to climate risk and natural asset management. the trainer requests the learners to write down their experiences in the chat room and encourages them to share about the physical changes and risks they have observed or encountered in their areas. the trainer is seeking input and contributions from the learners to facilitate a discussion on climate risk assessment and adaptation strategies. however, the trainer does not explicitly mention that learners need to justify what they said; rather, they"
